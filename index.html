            <h2>What is Force?</h2>
            <p>Force is a vector quantity that represents the interaction between objects. It has both magnitude and direction, and it can cause objects to accelerate, decelerate, or change direction.</p>
            <p>It is basically a push or pull on an object</p>
            <h2>Balanced and Unbalanced forces</h2>
            <div id="examplequery">
                <p>When an object recieves equal magnitude of force in opposite directions, it is called a <strong>balanced force</strong>.<br>
                For example, A box kept on a floor.<br>
                What happens here is that the box exerts a force on the floor and the floor exerts equal force on the box.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="examplequery">
                <p>When an object recieves unequal magnitude of force in opposite directions, it is called an <strong>unbalanced force</strong>.<br>
                For example, A man pushing a box.<br>
                What happens here is that the man exerts a force on the box but the box moves as there is no force resisting it on the box</p>

                <h3>Newton's First Law of Motion (Law of Inertia)</h3>
                <p>An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.</p>

                <h3>Newton's Second Law of Motion</h3>
                <p>The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. The equation is given by:</p>
                <p>F = m × a</p>

            <h2>Momentum</h2>
            <p>Momentum is a fundamental concept in physics that quantifies the motion possessed by an object. It is defined as the product of an object's mass and velocity. </p>
            <div class="formulae-section">
                <h3>Formula for momentum</h3>
                <p>p = m × v</p>
                <p><strong>Where:</strong></p>
                <p>p = Momentum(Kilogram Metre per second / kgms<sup>-1</sup>)</p>
                <p>m = Mass(kg)</p>
                <p>v = velocity(metre per second/ms<sup>-1</sup>)</p>    
            </div>       

            <h2>Conservation of Momentum</h2>
            <p>Conservation of momentum is a major law of physics which states that the momentum of a system is constant if no external forces are acting on the system. </p>
            <div class="formulae-section">
                <h3>Formula</h3>
                <p>Take an object A with:<br>
                    mass <b>m<sub>1</sub></b><br>
                    initial velocity <b>u<sub>1</sub></b><br>
                    final velocity <b>v<sub>1</sub></b>
                </p>
                
                <p>Take an object B with:<br>
                    mass <b>m<sub>2</sub></b><br>
                    initial velocity <b>u<sub>2</sub></b><br>
                    final velocity <b>v<sub>2</sub></b>
                </p>
                <p>The change in momentum for object A would be m<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub> - m<sub>1</sub>u<sub>1</sub><br> and the change in momentum for object B would be m<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub> - m<sub>2</sub>u<sub>2</sub></p>
                <p>From the Third Law of Motion, we know that</p>
                <p><strong>F<sub>BA</sub> = -F<sub>AB</sub></strong></p> Hence m<sub>1</sub>(v<sub>1</sub> - u<sub>1</sub>)/t = -m<sub>2</sub>(v<sub>2</sub> - u<sub>2</sub>)/t, resulting in <br> <strong>m<sub>1</sub>u<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub> = m<sub>2</sub>u<sub>2</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub></strong>

                    <p>A tennis ball hitting the racket with high velocity has a smaller momentum as it has lesser mass. Why does it have lesser momentum?</p>
